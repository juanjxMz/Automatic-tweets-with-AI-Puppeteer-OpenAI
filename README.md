# Automatic-tweets-with-AI-Puppeteer-OpenAI.

This project uses OpenAI and Puppeteer to automate the creation and posting of tweets on Twitter.

# There are two ways in which you can generate the text for the tweets:

## OpenAI API: 

You can use the OpenAI API if you have the tokens to access it. You should input the token in the environment variables and call the 'openAiApi' function in the 'app.js' file.

## Poor Option: 

This option queries the entered prompt directly in ChatGPT using Puppeteer. It is programmed for Gmail login, so you need to enter your credentials in the environment variables.
